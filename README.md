# tasker

- I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list.
- I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can (for example) edit our family shopping-list together.
- I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on things that are still pending.
- I as a user can add sub-tasks to my to-do items - so that I could make logical groups of tasks and see their overall progress.
- I as a user can make infinite nested levels of subtasks.
- I as a user can share my to-do list id that I can share with my friends.
- I as an owner/creator of a certain to-do list can freeze/unfreeze a to-do list I've created to avoid other users from mutating it


### Known bugs
Some known bugs that i've yet to fix:
- When joining a to-do list, sometimes the page does infinite loading
- Users can make their own to-do lists but newly created tasks are sent to everyone connected to server
